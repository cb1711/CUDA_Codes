To run the code first compile Img2Mat.cpp and Mat2Img.cpp using an IDE with openCV enabled.
Then run the python file executor.py

To change the image used change the name of the image in Img2Mat.cpp

Code can be made to run faster if both openCV and CUDA can be run on the same IDE then the need of writing the image in matrix form won't be there
